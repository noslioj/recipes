            Thanksgiving. Let's call it what it is â€” a never-ending cooking marathon than ends in piles of
             dirty dishes and everyone asleep on the couch with full bellies. Don't get me wrong, it's one
              of my favorite days of the year. But sometimes, you need your menu selections to do you a favor

                by thousands of home cooks, and they require little prep work and few ingredients. Save your energy
                for the main event and give these easy sides a try. Read on for our 15 best easy Thanksgiving side dishes.
